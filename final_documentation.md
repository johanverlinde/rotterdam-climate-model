# Rotterdam Climate Adaptation 3D Model - Final Documentation

## Project Overview

This project has created a comprehensive interactive 3D model of Rotterdam's center, focusing on the Nieuwe Maas river and Wilhelminapier area, to showcase the benefits of climate adaptation measures implemented in the city. The model allows users to:

1. Explore Rotterdam's innovative climate adaptation features, with special focus on green roofs and water squares
2. Simulate different weather conditions to see how these measures respond to climate challenges
3. Interact with the model through intuitive controls to toggle features and adjust parameters
4. View the city from multiple perspectives to understand the spatial relationships of adaptation measures

## Climate Adaptation Measures Featured

### Green Roofs
The model showcases Rotterdam's extensive green roof implementation, which currently covers more than 220,000 m² across the city. Green roofs provide multiple benefits:

- Water retention during heavy rainfall, reducing strain on drainage systems
- Temperature reduction during heat waves, mitigating urban heat island effect
- Increased biodiversity in urban environments
- Improved air quality and reduced CO₂ emissions
- Extended roof lifespan and improved building insulation

The interactive model allows users to toggle green roofs on and off, adjust coverage percentages, and visualize their effectiveness under different weather conditions.

### Water Squares
Rotterdam's innovative water squares, such as the Benthemplein Water Square, are multifunctional public spaces that transform during rainfall events to collect and store excess water. The model demonstrates how these squares:

- Collect and temporarily store rainwater during heavy precipitation
- Prevent flooding in surrounding urban areas
- Provide recreational spaces during dry periods
- Create attractive public spaces that enhance urban livability
- Connect to underground water storage systems

Users can toggle water squares between dry and wet states, adjust water levels, and observe how they respond to different rainfall intensities.

## Weather Simulation Features

The model includes simulation capabilities for different weather conditions:

### Normal Conditions
- Baseline scenario with moderate temperature and no precipitation
- Shows the city under typical conditions for reference

### Heavy Rainfall
- Simulates intense precipitation events
- Demonstrates water accumulation in water squares
- Shows green roof water retention capabilities
- Visualizes potential flooding in vulnerable areas

### Extreme Heat
- Simulates heat wave conditions with elevated temperatures
- Shows temperature differential between areas with and without green infrastructure
- Demonstrates cooling effect of climate adaptation measures
- Highlights urban heat island effect in areas lacking adaptation

### Storm Surge
- Simulates high water levels in the Nieuwe Maas river
- Shows potential flooding in low-lying areas
- Demonstrates how floating structures adapt to rising water
- Illustrates the importance of water management infrastructure

## Interactive Controls
