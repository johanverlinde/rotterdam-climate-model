# Rotterdam 3D Model - Stylized Base Model Components

## Terrain and Water Features

### Nieuwe Maas River
- Central feature of the model
- Stylized blue water surface with subtle texture
- Variable height capability for flood simulation
- Accurate riverbank contours based on geographical data

### Riverbanks and Embankments
- Detailed terrain along both sides of the river
- Reinforced embankments in central areas
- Natural slopes in less developed areas
- Prepared for water level rise visualization

## Key Landmarks and Buildings

  - Distinctive three-tower design
  - Simplified but recognizable form
  - Rooftop prepared for green roof implementation

- **Hotel New York**
  - Historic building with copper-domed towers
  - Former Holland-America Line headquarters
  - Distinctive architectural details
  - Waterfront position highlighted

- **World Port Center**
  - Modern high-rise office building
  - Simplified geometric form
  - Positioned according to actual location
  - Prepared for climate adaptation features

- **Luxor Theater**
  - Modern theater building
  - Distinctive form with simplified details
  - Positioned on Wilhelminapier as per actual location

### Erasmus Bridge
- Iconic "Swan" design connecting north and south banks
- Stylized but recognizable form
- Accurate positioning relative to Wilhelminapier
- Key visual reference point in the model

### Additional City Center Elements
- Simplified building blocks representing city center
- Major roads and transportation routes
- Public spaces and plazas
- Areas prepared for water square implementation

## Interactive Elements Framework

### Layer Structure
- Base terrain (static)
- Water surface (dynamic)
- Buildings (toggleable for climate features)
- Infrastructure (roads, bridges)
- Public spaces (toggleable for water squares)
- Climate adaptation features (prepared for implementation)
- Weather effects (prepared for simulation)

### Scene Setup
- Default view showing entire focus area
- Close-up views of key climate adaptation locations
- Aerial perspective for overall visualization
- Section views for underground systems

### Dynamic Components
- Building rooftops with state change capability
- Public spaces with water square transformation
- Water surface with variable height
- Temperature visualization overlay framework

## Technical Specifications

### Model Scale and Proportions
- Stylized representation with accurate relative proportions
- Recognizable landmarks with simplified details
- Vertical scale slightly exaggerated for better visualization
- Focus area covering approximately 1.5km x 1.5km of central Rotterdam

### Level of Detail
- Medium detail level for buildings and infrastructure
- Higher detail for climate adaptation features
- Simplified terrain with accurate major contours
- Optimized for interactive performance

### Visual Style
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Clear color coding for different elements
- Semi-realistic textures for key landmarks
- Abstract representation of climate effects

This stylized base model will serve as the foundation for implementing the interactive climate adaptation features and weather simulation capabilities in the subsequent development phases.
