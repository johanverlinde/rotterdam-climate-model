# Water Squares in Rotterdam

## Overview
Water squares (watersquares) are innovative multifunctional public spaces in Rotterdam that serve both as community gathering places and as water retention facilities during heavy rainfall. These squares are designed to temporarily collect and store rainwater, preventing flooding in surrounding areas while providing recreational spaces for residents.

## Key Examples

### Benthemplein Water Plaza
- Completed in 2013, it was the first of nine such squares in the city
- Co-designed with local community members (students, church, gym, offices, youth theatre)
- Features:
  - Sunken sports area with football goals and basketball hoops
  - Skateboarding areas
  - Small garden spaces
  - Outdoor bronze font for baptisms
- Water management capacity: Can store up to 8,500 bath tubs worth of rainwater
- Water from surrounding building roofs drains into two smaller basins and soaks in to replenish groundwater
- The large central basin has a pump that can transfer water into a nearby canal

### ZoHo Rain Garden
- Located in Rotterdam's Zomerhofkwartier district
- Transformed from a concrete car park into a public garden with meadow-like plants, trees, and seating
- Features a unique water storage system housed in tall black wood lettering spelling "ZoHo"
- The letters collect rainwater from a disused 2 km-long rail viaduct above
- Water can be released via an app-controlled pipe when rain is expected or when the garden needs irrigation

## Benefits
- Flood prevention by keeping excess rainwater out of the sewer system
- Creation of attractive public spaces that enhance community life
- Multifunctional use of urban space
- Educational value about water management
- Cooling effect during hot weather
- Inspiration for other cities (e.g., Surat, India is developing its own water squares)

## Current Status
- As of 2019, Rotterdam had developed nine water squares throughout the city
- These squares have become international showcases, attracting more than 80 groups of foreign officials to learn about Rotterdam's approach
