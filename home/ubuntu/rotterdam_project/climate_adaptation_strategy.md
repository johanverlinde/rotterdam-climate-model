# Rotterdam's Comprehensive Climate Adaptation Strategy

## Overview
Rotterdam, the largest European port, has developed an integrated climate change adaptation approach, formalized through the Rotterdam Climate Proof (2008) and the Rotterdam Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (2013). The city's approach is particularly significant as about 80% of Rotterdam lies below sea level, making it especially vulnerable to climate change impacts.

## Key Components

### Flood Defense System
- **Maeslantkering**: A flexible storm surge barrier
- **Permanent sand dunes** along the coast
- **Dykes** along the rivers
- **"Inner-dyke/outer-dyke" approach**:
  - Inner-dyke city (mostly below sea level): System of polders drained by water outlets and pumps, protected by smaller secondary dykes
  - Outer-dyke city area (3-5.5m above sea level): Home to about 40,000 citizens, adapted through innovative technologies and traditional approaches

### Urban Water Management
- **Water storage spaces**: Including the Museumpark car park underground water storage with capacity of 10,000 m³
- **Blue-Green Corridors**: Watercourses and ponding areas designed to facilitate natural hydrological processes
- **Water squares**: Multifunctional public spaces that temporarily collect and store rainwater
- **Green roofs**: Over 185,000 m² installed in 2014 alone

### Innovative Adaptation Measures
- **Floating buildings**: Particularly in outer-dyke areas
- **Water-resistant buildings**: With insulation of building facades and raised electrical installations
- **Infiltration zones**: Areas designed to absorb rainwater
- **Evacuation routes**: For emergency situations

## Strategic Aims
1. Strengthen a robust system of flood, storm water surge and sea-level rise defenses
2. Adapt urban space to combine three functions:
   - "Sponge" (water squares, infiltration zones, green spaces)
   - Protection (dykes and coastal protection)
   - Damage control (evacuation routes, water-resistant buildings, floating structures)
3. Increase city resilience through integrated planning
4. Foster opportunities that climate change brings:
   - Strengthening the economy
   - Improving quality of life
   - Increasing biodiversity

## Showcase Projects
- **Zomerhofkwartier (ZoHo)**: 100% climate-proof neighborhood-scale project
- **Benthemplein Water Plaza**: First of nine water squares in the city
- **DakAkker Urban Farm**: Green roof with smart water management system

## Reasons for Success
- Historical integration of land use and flood control
- Clear identification of climate change adaptation as a government priority
- Integration of climate change adaptation investment needs in the city budget
- Proactive planning for climate change resilience
