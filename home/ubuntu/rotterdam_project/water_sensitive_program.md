# Water Sensitive Rotterdam Program

## Overview
Water Sensitive Rotterdam (WSR) is a comprehensive program that aims to make the city more resilient to climate change impacts. As a delta city, Rotterdam is particularly vulnerable to changes in rainfall intensity, river drainage, and sea level rise. The program represents a significant shift in the city's approach to water management, focusing on small-scale measures that increase water absorption capacity while simultaneously improving public spaces.

## Historical Development
Rotterdam's approach to climate adaptation has evolved through several phases:
- First Water Plan (2001)
- Water City 2035 Vision (2005)
- Second Integrated Water Plan (2007)
- Rotterdam Climate Proof Programme (2008)
- Rotterdam Adaptation Strategy (2013)
- Resilience Programme (2014)
- Water Sensitive Rotterdam Programme (2015)
- Rotterdams WeerWoord (2019)

## Key Features

### Rotterdams WeerWoord (RWW)
- Addresses six climate themes: precipitation, heat, drought, subsidence, groundwater, and flooding
- Aims for a climate-proof city by 2030
- Focuses on both public spaces and private properties
- Three-pronged approach:
  1. Numerous small projects by citizens and businesses ("many small actions make a big difference")
  2. A few eye-catching showcase projects to enhance Rotterdam's image
  3. Effective large-scale projects operating in the background

### Implementation Strategy
- Treats rainwater as a valuable resource to be used locally whenever possible
- Makes water drainage visible to increase awareness
- Focuses on making the city a better place to live while promoting social cohesion
- Aims to involve municipal services, residents, businesses, interest groups, and associations on equal footing
- Evolving from a municipal plan to a city-wide movement

## Showcase Example: Climate-resilient Zomerhofkwartier (ZoHo) District
- Underwent gradual urban regeneration with input from users (residents, businesses, organizations, visitors)
- Transformed from an area with many vacant commercial units to a thriving district with 120 businesses
- Features the multifunctional Benthemplein water square, which acted as a catalyst for further development
- Demonstrates how climate adaptation can drive sustainable development, district greening, and social cohesion
- Serves as a test lab for knowledge institutes

## Achievements
- Various water squares throughout the city
- Alternative forms of water storage
- More green spaces and projects to remove paving
- 220,000 mÂ² of green roofs
- A rooftop park
- International recognition (80+ delegations visited in 2015)
- Creation of the Centre for Resilient Delta Cities as a knowledge portal
