# Rotterdam Climate Adaptive 3D Model Project

## Research Tasks
- [x] Research Rotterdam's climate adaptive measures
  - [x] Green roofs initiatives in Rotterdam
  - [x] Water squares implementation
  - [x] Urban water buffers systems
  - [x] Other climate adaptation measures in Rotterdam
- [x] Research 3D modeling tools suitable for urban planning
- [x] Collect Rotterdam geographical data
  - [x] City layout and topography
  - [x] Building data
  - [x] Existing green and water infrastructure

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Select appropriate 3D modeling tool
- [ ] Create base Rotterdam 3D model
- [ ] Add climate adaptive features to the model
  - [ ] Green roofs
  - [ ] Water squares
  - [ ] Urban water buffers
  - [ ] Other climate measures
- [ ] Finalize and render 3D model

## Documentation Tasks
- [ ] Document benefits of each climate adaptive measure
- [ ] Prepare final presentation
- [ ] Deliver completed model and documentation to user
