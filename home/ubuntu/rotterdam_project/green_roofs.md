# Green Roofs in Rotterdam

## Overview
Rotterdam has implemented extensive green roof initiatives as part of its climate adaptation strategy. The city has set an ambitious target of putting 1 square kilometer of its 18.5 square kilometers of flat rooftops to good use by 2030, through greening with plants and trees, adding solar panels, and utilizing the space for recreation.

## Key Examples

### DakAkker Urban Farm
- Located on top of an office building near Rotterdam's central station
- More than 20 meters (65 feet) above ground
- 1,000-square-meter farm growing herbs, vegetables, fruit trees, and wild flowers
- Produces edible flowers for local restaurants, honey, and liquid compost from its wormery
- Uses a "smart flow control" system connected to weather forecasting technology
- System can predict rain 12 hours ahead and empty stored water to make space for more
- Can be monitored remotely via an app

## Benefits
- Cooling effect inside buildings of 3 to 6 degrees Celsius
- Absorption of planet-warming emissions
- Water retention and management during heavy rainfall
- Creation of urban biodiversity
- Productive use of otherwise unused space
- Community engagement and social benefits

## Current Status
- As of 2019, Rotterdam had 360,000 square meters of green roofs
- Technology startup Sobolt helps monitor progress using aerial photography, satellite images, and AI-based techniques
- The city also has 168,000 square meters of solar panels on rooftops

## Future Plans
- Continue expanding green roof coverage toward the 1 square kilometer target by 2030
- Integrate more multifunctional roofs with greenery, water retention systems, and solar panels
- According to some sources, Rotterdam aims to convert over 10 million square feet of flat roofs into multifunctional green spaces
