# Rotterdam Interactive Climate Adaptation 3D Model - Base Model Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for creating the interactive base 3D model of Rotterdam's center, focusing on the Nieuwe Maas river and Wilhelminapier area. The model will serve as the foundation for demonstrating climate adaptation measures and weather simulation capabilities.

## Focus Area
- **Central Region**: Rotterdam city center
- **Key Features**: 
  - Nieuwe Maas river
  - Wilhelminapier and Wilhelminakade
  - Erasmus Bridge
  - Waterfront areas vulnerable to climate impacts

## Base Model Components

### Terrain and Water
- Stylized representation of the Nieuwe Maas river
- Accurate riverbank contours
- Water surface with variable height capability (for flood simulation)
- Terrain elevation based on Rotterdam's topography

### Buildings and Infrastructure
- Iconic buildings along Wilhelminapier:
  - De Rotterdam (150m tall, by Rem Koolhaas)
  - Hotel New York (former Holland-America Line headquarters)
  - World Port Center
  - Luxor Theater
- Erasmus Bridge (connecting city center to south bank)
- Major roads and transportation infrastructure
- Public spaces and plazas

### Preparation for Climate Features
- Building rooftops designed for green roof implementation
- Public spaces prepared for water square conversion
- Underground areas ready for water storage visualization
- Waterfront zones prepared for floating structure implementation

## Interactive Framework Setup

### Layer Organization
- Base terrain layer (static)
- Water layer (dynamic for water level changes)
- Building layer (with toggle capability for green roofs)
- Infrastructure layer (roads, bridges, etc.)
- Climate adaptation layer (prepared for toggle functionality)
- Weather effects layer (prepared for simulation)

### Scene Setup
- Default view showing Rotterdam center
- Close-up views of key climate adaptation locations
- Aerial perspective for overall city visualization
- Section cut views to reveal underground systems

### Dynamic Components
- Preparation for water level changes
- Building components with state changes (normal/green roof)
- Public spaces with state changes (normal/water square)
- Temperature visualization overlay framework

## Weather Simulation Framework
- Sun position controls for different times of day
- Shadow study capability
- Preparation for rainfall visualization
- Heat mapping overlay system

## Technical Specifications
- Model scale: Stylized but proportionally accurate
- Level of detail: Medium (recognizable buildings with simplified features)
- File organization: Modular components for easy updating
- Performance optimization: Balanced detail for interactive performance

## Next Steps
After completing the base model:
1. Add detailed climate adaptation features
2. Implement weather simulation based on historical data
3. Create interactive controls for toggling features
4. Finalize and render the complete interactive model
